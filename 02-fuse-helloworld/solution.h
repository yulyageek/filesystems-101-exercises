/**
   Implement this function to to mount a "helloworld" FUSE filesystem to @mntp.
   The root of a filesystem must contain the following entries (the owner UID
   and GID may be different):

   $ ls -lha /helloworld
   drwxrwxr-x. 2 9091 9091 19 Oct  6 05:39 .
   drwxr-xr-x. 4 9091 9091 19 Oct  6 05:39 ..
   -r--------. 1 9091 9091 19 Oct  6 05:39 hello

   The content of "hello" must be (without quotes) "hello, ${PID}\n" where
   PID is the id of a process that reads "hello", and "\n" is the newline.
   It is OK to report the size of "hello" that does not match the content.

   Any attempt write to a file must report EROFS.
